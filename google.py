# complaints so far:

# - why are you running python 2.7 (fixed with shebang anyway)
# - why dont you tell us what the errors are in some of the test runs, e.g. we spent hours on one of the problems before and realised it was just a simple syntax error - spent like 3 hours finding it
# - LVL4 Q2 read bottom part (stuff about hitting corners at a non 45 degree angle)
# - SYMPY DOES NOT WORK
